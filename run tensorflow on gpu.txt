Install GPU drivers
Install Docker Desktop
Open Docker Desktop

1. Using docker run:
Run cmd: docker run --gpus all -it -p 8888:8888 -v S:\docker-desktop-data\shared_folder:/shared_folder tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu-jupyter
    - set 'S:\docker-desktop-data\shared_folder' to whatever you want your shared_folder to be
Open VSCode
    - Install Dev Containers extension if you havent already
    - click the green >< icon in the bottom left
    - select 'attach to running container' and select the container
        - new VSCode window opens
    - open a jupyter notebook
    - select kernel 'Existing Jupyter Server'
        - paste the jupyter URL from the cmd where you ran docker

2. Using docker compose: (i think this works better?)
Follow instructions here:

CMD in the folder where your docker-compose.yml lies
CMD: docker-compose up

Open VSCode
    - Install Dev Containers extension if you havent already
    - click the green >< icon in the bottom left
